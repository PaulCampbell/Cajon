<p>
	I understand how important it is to have insight into how your customers are using your web sites. 
</p>
<p>
	With this in mind, all of our web based solutions come with the powerful Google Analytics system built in from the start. Together we will get to the bottom exactly who is using your site and how. 
</p>
<h2>
	Tidy user interfaces...
</h2>
<p>
	Clean designs and use of semantic HTML5 means not only will your application be accessible, with the best chance of working on as many devices as possible, it also comes with the best chance of top results on Google's search listings.
